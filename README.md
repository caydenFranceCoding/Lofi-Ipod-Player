# Lofi-Ipod-Player

Im a big lofi listener wwhile i code or study my school work. I Love listening to calming music and lofi has done that for me. I thought it would bea cool
little project idea to make my own web media player. 

There is around 1400 lines of code throughout this whole project. Im sure i could have figured out another way to maybe make this a little more compiled but for right now, i am happy with what i have. Another small fun project out of the books.
Onto the next!
